# PyMouseMover
A jiggler designed in Python to move your mouse to keep you active on your machine. 

The motivation for this is I work across three machines, so to prevent the screen from locking and me not showing as present on my socials I have designed this simple python script to be triggered in the terminal when you are away from your main machine. This has been designed on **Python 3.7.11** and works with that. It relies on internal base install libraries, so will work when installed on to any Python machine that has a base install and without the need to create a virtual environment. 

## Triggering the tool

'''{python}
# Run this in the terminal
python MouseJiggle.py
'''
